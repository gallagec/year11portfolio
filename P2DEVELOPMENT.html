<h1>PLAYER OWN PATH</h1>
<h3><p>As an introduction we can present that  the text adventure game we created is cinsisted with an amazing beginning.We have presented a story which is player probably curious about and we have given the opperunity to player to thinking and solving about the problems.We have given questions about what does the player think about the problem and if his answer was correct we are revealing few information relevant to that I also hve created a quiz for the players who are interested in various ubjects If their answer was correct they will gain points  and otherwise  If the player answered question wrongly he or she cannot gain score for that question and s a result they will lose about 1 points of the whole score.There is a story behind the quiz and if they could answer every question correctly they can reveal the secreat which has been hided behind the story.The quiz is about subjects and player can choose his or her beat option and favourite for the quiz.It makes feeling easy and giving entertaintment with improving the knowledge   </p></h3>
<h3><p>As I told above there ar efew conditions for the game with quiz They are not taking more time than the limited because we have mad it as if the limited time passed the question will be switched We have added options for the questions and they will be useful for the players to assume a correct answer among all</p></h3>
<h1>Development</h1>
<p><h3>The processing of the quiz and the option we added with the quiz as a game made a better overwiew of the game. As an example I should say first steps player have to do for signing uo the game Most of the steps  Player has to enter a password with valid characters as we included the instructions we have presented instructions before starting that. to we added  them to confirm the security and the reallity of that without taking of idea about that it will be harder to playing that. We have made the quiz connected with a story Story will be revealed  after answering the questions while quiz is running</h3></p>

      <th>inputing a name as name and  entering a password consisted with 9 characters and also consisted with numbers and special characters
        entering an invalid password and seeing what happens  It should not be consisted with numbers or special characters.That makes it invlaid/<th>
      <th>The expectation was the same as output displaying the name we enterd instead of the name variable and if password consisted with 9 characters the coding will be continued and if the password do not match with the conditions we presented not running the programme and not accepting it as password</th>
      <th>The code did run as the name we entered instead of the name variable nad when we entered the password with 9 charcters and including numbers   and special charcters code has been continued  and it gave the expected result But when we entered an invalind password it did not continued and it displayed as again</th>
