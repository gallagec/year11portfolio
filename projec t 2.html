        <h5>Aesthetics</h5>
        <p>aesthetics, the philosophical study of beauty and taste. It is closely related to the philosophy of art, which is concerned with the nature of art and the concepts in terms of which individual works of art are interpreted and evaluated.An example of a language that describes your aesthetic preferences in this way might be “My tastes in interior design are much like my favorite coffee shop in San Francisco  I am always calm and collected there.” Aesthetics can also be defined by what is my favorite color.The three aesthetic theories of art criticism are most commonly referred to as Imitationalism, Formalism, and Emotionalism. on realistic representation. of art using the principles of art. a response of feelings, moods, or emotions in the viewer.</p>
        <p> Game aesthetics are the auditory, visual and the interactive eleements that create  the mood, style and  the atmosphere of the game  These are the main things include in our game as aesthetics They are needed to attract the teenages to game and they really help on the building of our game and creating it as attracting the minds of teenagers  We have addedcolourful backgrounds and the pictures of the targets we giving to the players and the instruction with key points  <p>
        <h5>Functionality</h5>
        <p>This game is mainly targeted on the teenagers who are interested in solving problems and with a mind which filled from curiousity.Main function of the game is growing up the knowledge of the player and also giving the entertaintment with winnig the game and revealing the story which has been secretly before going to the next level  Struggling has been decreased by us with doing the justice in game and making it as always keeping the mind of the player in a one point<p>
        <p>Functionality refers to whether a design works and helps the users meet their goals and needs. From products such as chairs or tables to designs such as books or web interfaces, functionality varies but is everywhere.</p>
        <h5>Usability</h5>
        <p>Usability can be described as the capacity of a system to provide a condition for its users to perform the tasks safely, effectively, and efficiently while enjoying the experience.A usability study may be conducted as a primary job function by a usability analyst or as a secondary job function by designers, technical writers, marketing personnel, and others. It is widely used in consumer electronics, communication, and knowledge transfer objects</p>
        <p>Making sure that the user can easily to use it without any struggles and Giving a clear instructions that can make the user easily to understand how to play the games without any struggles when they are playing the games is more important tasks which have done by us to take a high usability  in the game we made.Most of the players will be teenagers So we have thought that it is better to making id a bit harder but not looks like a children' s game  and I have done it complicated rather than akid" s game  But I think it is really creates a good background <p> 
        

        <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
        <p>This reffers as the creations of mind. It neverbelongs to the somone who made a copy of someone's invention.It only reffers to the person who invented or manufactured it.It can be an invention (patent / utility model), a design (industrial design), a brand name (trademark, or a literary and artistic work (copyright).</p>
        <p>Intellectual property is a category of intangible assets. They can't be held and don't necessarily have a physical presence. These assets are created using human intellect. Such property can take many forms and can include artwork, symbols, logos, brand names, and designs. Here we have use our own ideas with the making this game and we havr not used any others property or creation as copy and paste </p>
        <h5>Privacy <h5>
        <p>Privacy is a fundamental human right that underpins freedom of association, thought and expression, as well as freedom from discrimination. But it's hard to define. Different countries offer different views, as do individuals. Generally speaking, privacy includes the right: to be free from interference and intrusion.A privacy statement is a statement that sets out what personal information a company, service provider, or other agency collects and what it will use it for. It may be published on a website, or included with a product or service.sometimes creations which made by designers include the passwords, birthdays of the user or any personal information But it is importsant that keep privacy with the users and creators<p>
        <p>the making of our adventure games is clearly recommmends the privacy of any player who involves in our game and we have confirmed to keep the personal information such as usernames, password, birthdates and every player can behave with the frrdom in game according to the instructions given by us  Privacy plays a major role in the success and the quality of our game with a good confidence..</p>
        <h5>ethical</h5>
        <p>Ethical considerations in web design include accessibility, user privacy, transparent information presentation, and avoiding deceptive practices.Creators and platforms can address these challenges by developing and adhering to clear ethical guidelines. These guidelines should cover issues like the verification of information, consent for using personal data, and the promotion of inclusivity and accessibility.Adhering to relevant laws and regulations imitators implementing ethical website design. Designers and web developers must know any legal requirements that apply to their specific industry or location, such as data protection laws, accessibility standards, and environmental regulations.</p>
        <p> Our desingning of the adventure games is ethical usefully and it is consisting the questions which are related to ovwer world wild and we have confirmed that the answers given by us as correctanswers are extremely right  We did not neglect the requests of the players who are interested in these kind of games and we tried our best to do far more better than previous onesWe have considered what is right but not what is easy to do. This is the way we have used to show the ethical nature of making  text adventure games</p>
         <h5> legal</h5>   
        <p>Legal technological developments have been both lauded as the promising future of the law and derided as a danger to the fundamentals of justice. This article helps reconcile these divergent perspectives by providing a definition of legal technology and a framework through which to understand its different types and their potential implications for the legal system and society more generally. Mapping technologies according to how specifically they afford legal uses, and the directness with which they engage in unmediated legal activities reveals different technological categories and their differing propensities to have legal, functional or general implications. Some common legal issues in computer science include data protection and privacy concerns, intellectual property rights regarding software and algorithms, cybercrime such as hacking or identity theft, and legal compliance in software development and data usage.</p>
         <p>Legal is obvious by the  everything we have done in our designing has  been corresponding to the law and also with the intellectual property We have not stolen any property of others and any copy and pasting from other creators' designing. Most important thing which shows the legality of our designing is not including any quotes which has substracted by any source... Sometimes we have got knowledge of a normal designing be taking a look of an exmple.But it never affect to the losing legal of the designing.</p>
