    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Low poly is a polygon mesh in 3D computer graphics that has a relatively small number of polygons. Low poly meshes occur in real-time applications (e.g. games) as contrast with high-poly meshes in animated movies and special effects of the same era.One of the most important aspects of low-poly game art is the general shape and silhouette of the  models used by me. I did make sure that each model has a clear and recognizable outline, even from a distance. I  atchieved this by using strong shapes and angles to define the form of  the models.I have designed a tall type of human.the main purpose of that creating is the ebtertaintment of the  small children.But not matter for adults. I have added legs, feets with bones to  an easy transition.</p>

    <h2>End Users</h2>
    <p>I am making a character and It is better to knowing what is the average polycount for a lowpoly - midpoly character.
        My character looks quite lowpoly but has 3000 polys but when you take the eye spheres off it should be more less 1400 polys left is that good?I have made this specially for small children.I hav esimply made this for them. Children like transitions and emotions.So i have added them to this.</p>

        <h2>Implications</h2>
        <h5>Aesthetics</h5>
        <p>aesthetics, the philosophical study of beauty and taste. It is closely related to the philosophy of art, which is concerned with the nature of art and the concepts in terms of which individual works of art are interpreted and evaluated.An example of a language that describes your aesthetic preferences in this way might be “My tastes in interior design are much like my favorite coffee shop in San Francisco  I am always calm and collected there.” Aesthetics can also be defined by what is my favorite color.The three aesthetic theories of art criticism are most commonly referred to as Imitationalism, Formalism, and Emotionalism. on realistic representation. of art using the principles of art. a response of feelings, moods, or emotions in the viewer.</p>
        <p> My Low poly art, short for low polygon art, is a distinctive artistic style emphasizing minimalism and simplicity. It is characterized by its use of geometric shapes and a limited number of polygons to create visually striking and stylized imagery. In low poly art, objects and characters are represented using fewer polygons, resulting in a blocky and angular appearance.
            The term “low poly” originates from the world of 3D computer graphics, where models were initially limited by technical constraints regarding polygon count. However, low poly art has evolved beyond its technical limitations and has become a deliberate artistic choice. I intentionally adopt this style to create a unique visual language that evokes nostalgia, simplicity, and aesthetic charm.       </p>

        <h5>Functionality</h5>
        <p>Low poly characters have somewhat more permissive rules for topology, because they won't be subdivided. Maybe some of the small polygons around the border of the hair could be merged, as well as some parts of edge loops that won't affect the silhouette too much.</p>
        <p>In my charactre designing I have used feets, bones and other  body parts for an easy transition.I think it is better to small children who are between 5 and 7 years old. . ALL meshes will be triangulated by the game engine via a process called “tri-stripping” - so trying to maintain quads is pointless and can actually be a detriment to how your model “reads”. A quad can be “folded” due to the non-planar nature of organic models - so - that quad can read as a ‘depression’ when you want it to read as an edge. Game engines will almost always make bad decisions when it comes to triangulating your quads, so, you will want to triangulate your own to maintain control of the look of the model. (NOTE: Even Blender triangulates quads internally - you just can’t see the “hidden” edge that splits a quad into two triangles - but that edge can be “flipped” if necessary).This should be legal for if the designer designed his character by blender.
